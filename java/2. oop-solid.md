# OOP and SOLID

## 1. OOP

### Countdown

1. Create a class called `Counter`
2. Create a instance variable called `value`. Initialize it to 0
3. Implement a `incr` method which increments `value` by 1
4. Implement a `decr` method which decrements `value` by 1
5. Implement a `incrby` method which accepts a integer, `n` and increments `value` by `n`
6. Implement a `decrby` method which accepts a integer, `n` and decrements `value` by `n`

### Triangle and points


Create a Triangle class.

Initially this class will have an empty list of points.
Add a `add_point` method which adds the point to the list of points.
Add a `perimeter` method which calculates the perimeter of a triangle.
Add a `is_equal` method which accepts another triangle object as an argument and checks whether the two triangles have the same list of points.

Create a triangle object, `t1` and add the following points:

0, 0
0, 3
4, 0

Find its perimeter

Create another triangle object, `t2` with the following points:

1, 2
2, 1
1, 5

Find its perimeter

Check whether `t1` and `t2` are equal

Create another triangle object, `t3`, with the following points:

```
1, 2
2, 1
1, 5
```

Do the following operations:


```
t1 == t3
t1.is_equal(t3)
t3.is_equal(t1)

```

Rename `is_equal` to `__eq__`:

Do the following operations

```
t1 == t3
```

### Data Munging Problem

Practice Data Munging problem (http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging).

Spike out the first version just make it work.

What is a spike?

A spike is used to determine how much work will be required to solve or work around a software issue. Typically, a "spike test" involves gathering additional information or testing for easily reproduced edge cases.

In the second version:

Create proper classes. Try to apply OOPs concepts and do it using minimum amount of code.

Check your work - total 5 files
* Create a DataExtractor class - which only extracts data. Pass arguments to customize
* Create a DataAnalyzer class - which only calculates the min diff. Pass arguments to customize.
* Create a Calculator class - which initializes the two classes above and executes.
* Soccer and Weather files - Create objects of Calculator class and pass arguments. Make sure you use named variables for column names. Do not pass 6 directly.
